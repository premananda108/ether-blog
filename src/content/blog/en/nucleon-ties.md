**Important**: The presented methodology is a **working tool** that evolves as data accumulates. It does not claim finality, but offers a systematic approach to understanding the structure of nuclei.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Article

So far, we have described individual nuclei: Helium, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen. But how do we know our model is correct? 

Today we will:
1. Formulate the **principles of designing** nuclei.
2. Develop **verification methods** — ways to check that the model does not contradict experiments.

## 🔧 Nucleon Ties — The Core of the Structure

In the previous article, we introduced the concept of ether ties. Now let's name them more precisely — **nucleon ties**.

### What is this?

When protons and neutrons approach each other, their ether flows form closed circulation loops. These loops act as **hydrodynamic ties**:

- A **proton** ejects ether at high speed.
- A **neutron** passes ether through itself under the influence of a pressure difference.
- A **tie** is a flow of ether that strings nucleons into a "garland".

**Result**: The ether tie presses on the nucleons, compressing them into a single structure.

## 🧱 Building Blocks of Nuclei

Before building, you need to know your "bricks":

### 1. Alpha particle (α) — the main block
- **Composition**: 2 protons + 2 neutrons.
- **Structure**: Protons on one axis, neutrons on a perpendicular one (a cross).
- **Properties**: Exceptionally stable, forms 4 nucleon ties.

### 2. Deuteron (d) — the minimal block
- **Composition**: 1 proton + 1 neutron.
- **Properties**: Weakly bound, often serves as a "tail" or superstructure.

### 3. Individual nucleon
- **Neutron**: adding one creates isotopes.
- **Proton**: adding one creates other elements.

## 📐 Principles of Nucleus Design

### Principle 1: Compactness
**The nucleus strives to occupy minimum volume.** Alpha particles are packed as densely as possible. Long "loose" chains are unstable.

### Principle 2: Orthogonality of axes
**Neighboring alpha particles are rotated 90° relative to each other.** This allows the neutrons of one α-particle to "dock" with the protons of the neighboring one.

*Example*: In Carbon-12, the central α-particle is rotated 90° relative to the outer ones.

### Principle 3: Neutrons as spacers for docking
**Neutrons serve as "inlets" for ether flows.** Protons eject ether, and the flow is drawn in through neutrons. When assembling a nucleus, protons must alternate with neutrons.

*Mechanism*: Ejection from a proton → entry into a neighbor's neutron → creation of a tie.

### Principle 4: Asymmetry creates functionality
**The addition of "extra" nucleons or their rearrangement determines chemical properties.**

*Examples*:
- **Carbon (3α)** — symmetrical → 4 valence electrons.
- **Nitrogen (3α + d)** — lateral deuteron → valency 3/4 + lone pair.
- **Oxygen (4α in a T-shape)** — asymmetry → powerful oxidizer.

## 🔬 Model Verification Methods

How do we verify that our 3D nucleus model is correct? Here are 3 independent tests:

### Test 1: Nuclear Reactions
**Principle:** Known nuclear reactions (including decay) show which nucleons "stick out" and how the nucleus splits into blocks.

- *Example 1 — Rutherford's Reaction (1919):* `¹⁴N + α → ¹⁷O + p`
  **Analysis:** The alpha particle knocks out the "weak" proton of the deuteron. If the proton weren't on the outside of the Nitrogen nucleus, the reaction wouldn't proceed so easily.
- *Example 2 — Beryllium-9 Decay:* `⁹Be + α → ¹²C + n`
  **Analysis:** When an alpha particle is added, the "balancing" neutron becomes redundant and is ejected. This confirms that it was not part of the rigid framework of alpha particles.

**Conclusion:** The nucleus is a construction set. We can understand its details by looking at how it breaks or rearranges during collisions.

### Test 2: Valency
**Principle:** The number of active "funnels" (ether suction zones) equals the chemical valency of the element.

*How it works:*
1. Build a 3D model of the nucleus.
2. Find all "funnels" pointing outward and accessible to external atoms.
3. Count their number — this should match the valency.
*(Why it works: A vortex electron can only enter a strong funnel. The number of strong funnels equals the number of possible bonds).*

### Test 3: Molecular Geometry
**Principle:** The spatial shape of the nucleus determines the bond angles in molecules.
- **Water (H₂O):** 104.5° angle — predicted by the pressure of the "crown" (top α-particle) of Oxygen-16.
- **Ammonia (NH₃):** Pyramid — predicted by the pressure of the lateral flow of Nitrogen-14.
- **Methane (CH₄):** Tetrahedron — predicted by the 4 equidistant flows of Carbon-12.

## 🔄 Nucleus Design Algorithm

1. **Determine the composition:** How many protons and neutrons are in the isotope?
2. **Divide into blocks:** How many complete α-particles can be assembled? Is there a remainder (d, p, n)?
3. **Assemble the framework:** Arrange the α-particles considering compactness and orthogonality.
4. **Add superstructures:** Attach deuterons and individual nucleons to free ports.
5. **Verify:** Run the resulting model through the 3 tests (nuclear reactions, valency, molecular angles).

## 🧪 Example: Designing the Lithium Nucleus

Let's apply the algorithm in practice. Lithium (Li) is element No. 3, and it has two stable isotopes.

### Lithium-6 (⁶Li)
- **Step 1. Composition:** 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons.
- **Step 2. Division:** 6 nucleons = 1 α-particle + remainder (1p + 1n). The remainder is a deuteron! Formula: `⁶Li = α + d`.
- **Step 3. Assembly:** The alpha particle is the central block. A neutron of the α-particle faces the proton of the deuteron. The deuteron attaches to the side.

![Lithium-6 and Lithium-7 Nucleus Diagram](../../../assets/images/Li6-7.png)

*Verification (Nuclear Reactions)*: `⁶Li + n → ⁴He + ³H (tritium)`
A neutron enters the nucleus → the deuteron captures it → turns into tritium (1p + 2n) → detaches from the α-particle. Model confirmed!

### Lithium-7 (⁷Li)
Adding a proton to ⁷Li "completes" it into a second α-particle, which is confirmed by the Cockcroft-Walton reaction (1932): `⁷Li + p → 2α`.

## 📐 Beryllium: Why does a neutron stabilize the nucleus?

**Beryllium-8 (⁸Be = 2α)** is highly unstable. The two α-particles simply repel each other.

![Two alpha particles of Beryllium-8](../../../assets/images/Be.png)

**Beryllium-9** (`⁹Be = 2α + n`) is 100% stable!
*The key to stability is the additional neutron:*
1. Two α-particles are arranged in a line and rotated differently.
2. The additional neutron is on the same axis, weighting down the structure.
3. The proton of the left α-particle ejects a flow → it enters the added neutron → a directed tie is formed, rigidly binding both α-particles together.

## 💎 Boron: Expanding the Lithium Model

Boron (B) is two alphas and a "tail".

**Boron-10 (¹⁰B = 2α + d)**:

**Boron-11 (¹¹B = 2α + t)**:
![Boron-11 Nucleus](../../../assets/images/B11.png)

*Verification*: `¹¹B + p → 3α` — the proton completes the triton into an α-particle, and the nucleus decays into three stable alpha particles.

## 🌟 Summary

The structure of a nucleus is not a chaotic set of particles, but a precise engineering design. Knowing the geometry of the nucleus allows us to:
1. Understand the reasons for the stability or radioactivity of isotopes.
2. Predict chemical properties and molecular shapes.
3. Explain rare nuclear reactions.
