# Ether Blog

**Ether Blog** is a multilingual platform dedicated to exploring alternative physics, specifically the theory of **Ether Dynamics**. It challenges conventional quantum mechanical models by proposing a mechanical, engineering-based approach to the structure of matter.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Full English and Russian localization.
- **Modern Aesthetic**: High-end "Deep Space" design using glassmorphism and neon accents.
- **Content Focused**: Optimized for reading long-form articles about atomic structures and vortex theory.
- **Performance**: Built with **Astro** for lightning-fast, static delivery.
- **Scientific Visualization**: Integrated support for high-quality images and diagrams of atomic observations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Variables, Blurs, Gradients)
- **Content**: Markdown & MDX
- **Images**: Sharp for optimized media delivery
- **Deployment**: Static Site Generation (SSG)
